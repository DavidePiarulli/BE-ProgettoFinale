# **Epic Energy Services v-0.1**

This is the final project assignment for the *Epicode School Bootcamp*, it is primarly a back-end program with some front-end integrated using *Thymeleaf* and *Bootstrap*.

The goal of the project was to create a functional client managing program that could do simple *CRUD* operations with all the entities and write the changes made into the *PosgreSQL* database while allowing specific operations to users with certain roles only.

A simple *CSV* reader is implemented to read two files refering to all cities and provinces in Italy and mapping them accordingly in the database.
The data loading is performed with a *POST* method.

Spring Security is also implemented using a bearer token to define authorization between *"USER"* role and *"ADMIN"* role. All the *GET* methods require the "USER" role to be performed while the *POST* and the *DELETE* methods require the *"ADMIN"*
role to be performed.

For the time being the Front-End can be viewed only locally [*LOCALHOST*](http://localhost:8080) 

I'm working on a solution to deploy it on Heroku.
